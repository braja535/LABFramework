1
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,719
Thing of beauty.

2
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:15,765
Good morning, sir!

3
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:18,646
Yet another on-time delivery from...

4
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,196
Get the hell out of my face, canner.

5
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,444
Have a nice day!

6
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:30,119
<i>And we believe our Destination Anywhere</i>
<i>package to be the best value.</i>

7
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:35,281
<i>Let us take you to your dream destination</i>
<i>aboard our orbital spaceplane, the X-82.</i>

8
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:44,886
<i>Try Jazztown 's synthetic Chicago-style</i>
<i>pizza. Tastes as good as you remember.</i>

9
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,039
<i>Glowfish! The world's hottest-selling</i>
<i>transgenic treats.</i>

10
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:52,643
<i>Your children will love</i>
<i>the new colors too!</i>

11
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,718
- Excuse me, sir.
<i>- Total performance.</i>

12
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,276
<i>Total readiness. Total security.</i>

13
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,642
<i>So goodbye to upgrades</i>
<i>and service calls.</i>

14
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,798
<i>An uplink to USR's central computer...</i>

15
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,323
<i>... provides this state-of-the-art robot</i>

16
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:09,524
<i>The Nestor Class 5
<i>is tomorrow's robot today.</i>

17
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,596
Spoon! Spoonie!

18
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:19,757
Hold up. Hold on!
Excuse me, excuse me.

19
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,316
- Spoon, where you been at?
- Just away, Farber.

20
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:25,240
Oh, yeah, away? Like vacation?
That's nice.

21
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:28,678
I got a favor to ask.
I need to borrow your car.

22
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:33,318
This is different. I got this fine-ass
yummy... She is complete and agreeable.

23
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,199
I mean, ass-hot spankable.

24
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,967
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

25
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,436
- Let me get the damn-ass keys.
- First of all...

26
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:44,600
...stop cussing. You're not good at it.
- Give me 10 for the bus, then, man.

27
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,363
- Go home.
- That's strike one, Spoon. Strike one!

28
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:07,679
<i>This is such a valuable day...</i>

29
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,963
You talk to Marci?

30
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,077
No, Gigi, I haven't talked to Marci.

31
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,398
When I was coming up,
we didn't just marry someone...

32
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,240
...then divorce them,
then not talk to them.

33
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,079
Del, don't play with me.

34
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:26,525
I bet if I stopped cooking,
you'd call Marci.

35
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:30,445
Boy, what is that on your feet?

36
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:34,120
Converse All Stars, vintage 2004.

37
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,364
Don't turn your face up.
I know you want some. Just ask.

38
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,961
No, thank you very much.

39
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,000
- Sweet potato pie.
- Put that on a plate.

40
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:49,403
I've seen on TV they're giving away
some of them new robots in the lottery.

41
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,925
You know, Gigi, those robots
don't do anybody any good.

42
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,124
Of all the people on God's earth,
you should know better.

43
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:00,882
Sometimes the stuff
that comes out of your mouth!

44
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,323
You listening to me, Del?

45
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:16,521
Hey!

46
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,001
Hey!

47
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:24,002
Hold my pie. Sir, hold it or wear it.

48
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,636
Move!

49
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:40,440
Freeze!

50
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:45,846
Hey! Stop!

51
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,206
Stop!

52
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,000
I said, stop!

53
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,278
Relax. Relax.

54
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:09,199
I'm a police officer.

55
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,516
You...

56
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,602
...are an asshole.

57
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,077
- Ma'am, is that your purse?
- Of course it's my purse.

58
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,603
I left my inhaler at home.
He was running it out to me.

59
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,327
I saw a robot running with the purse
and assumed...

60
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,683
What? Are you crazy?

61
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:29,285
- I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.
- Don't apologize.

62
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:33,042
You're doing what you're supposed
to do. But what are you doing?

63
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,566
Have a lovely day, ma'am.

64
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:40,005
You're lucky I can't breathe,
or I'd walk all up and down your ass.

65
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,320
Lead by example.

66
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,717
It says that right on your badge.

67
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,918
- We gonna talk about this?
- About what?

68
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:14,046
"Help! Police! That robot stole
my dry cleaning!"

69
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,718
Oh, you wanna talk about that.

70
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:19,999
Detective...

71
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:24,760
...how many robots snatch purses?
- John, the thing is running...

72
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,317
How many robots in the world...

73
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,160
...have ever committed a crime?
- Define crime.

74
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,961
- Answer my question, damn it.
- None, John.

75
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:39,240
Now tell me what happened today.

76
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:41,919
Nothing.

77
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,365
Better be the last nothing.

78
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:55,802
Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be
back? Because you can take your time.

79
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:59,118
I'm fine, John. Thank you.

80
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,083
Better here than sitting around
at home.

81
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,843
Homicide. Spooner.

82
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,957
<i>Please take the next exit to your right.</i>

83
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,643
<i>Welcome, Detective Spooner.</i>

84
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:49,639
<i>Welcome to U.S. Robotics.</i>
<i>You have entered the garage-level lobby.</i>

85
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:54,284
<i>Please use the elevators for direct</i>
<i>access to the main level concourse.</i>

86
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:55,800
<i>Thank you.</i>

87
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:00,197
- Good to see you again, son.
- Hello, doctor.

88
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:04,082
Everything that follows is a result
of what you see here.

89
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:09,681
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

90
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:11,758
You must ask the right questions.

91
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,804
Why did you call me?

92
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,444
I trust your judgment.

93
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:19,679
Normally, this wouldn't require
a homicide detective.

94
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:23,886
But then, our interactions have never
been entirely normal, agreed?

95
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,117
You got that right.

96
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,156
Is there something you want
to say to me?

97
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,876
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

98
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:35,515
<i>You must ask the right questions.</i>

99
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,925
Why would you kill yourself?

100
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:41,683
<i>That, detective, is the right question.</i>

101
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,797
<i>Program terminated.</i>

102
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,998
Goodbye, old man.

103
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:23,522
- Afternoon, boys.
- Hey, detective.

104
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,036
- Enlighten me.
- What you see is what you get:

105
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,401
Massive impact trauma.

106
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,161
U.S. Robotics. I gotta
get my kid something.

107
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,558
- Anything upstairs?
- Nada.

108
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:34,877
Door was security locked
from the inside.

109
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:39,438
Wham, splat. The guy's a jumper
for sure.

110
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:49,595
We gotta be smart about this.
Let's deal with it later.

111
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,159
Detective.

112
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,239
Lawrence Robertson.

113
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,605
Richest man in the world.
I've seen you on television.

114
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:02,683
- Can I offer you coffee?
- Sure, why not. It's free, right?

115
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,596
I don't think anyone saw this coming.

116
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:13,043
You know, I should have, I suppose.
I knew him 20 years.

117
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:17,439
Alfred practically invented robotics.
He wrote the Three Laws.

118
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:23,517
But I guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons.

119
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:26,599
- So whatever I can do to help...
- Sugar.

120
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,367
- I'm sorry?
- For the coffee.

121
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,040
Sugar?

122
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:34,758
You thought I was calling you "sugar."
You're not that rich.

123
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:37,805
- It's on the table.
- Thank you.

124
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:44,725
When Lanning fell, he was holding
the little green...?

125
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,923
- The holographic projector.
- Right.

126
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:50,119
Why do you think Lanning's hologram
would've called me?

127
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:53,438
- I assumed you knew him.
- Yeah. I knew him.

128
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,956
Holograms are just prerecorded
responses...

129
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,800
...designed to give
the impression of intelligence.

130
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:02,686
This one was programmed to call you
upon his suicide.

131
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,196
- Death.
- I'm sorry?

132
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,723
It was programmed to call me
in the event of Lanning's death.

133
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:11,237
Suicide is a type of death, detective.

134
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:18,517
- Don't misunderstand my impatience.
- Oh, no. Go. Go.

135
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:23,444
A really big week for you folks
around here.

136
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:25,882
You gotta put a robot in every home.

137
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:30,519
Look, this is not what I do, but I got
an idea for one of your commercials.

138
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:34,282
You could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair.

139
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:38,440
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair twice as fast.

140
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:43,677
Then you superimpose on the screen,
"USR: Shitting on the little guy."

141
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:47,280
That would be the fade-out.

142
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:51,076
Yeah, I see. I suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

143
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:55,201
Maybe you'd have banned the Internet
to keep the libraries open.

144
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,356
Prejudice never shows much reason.

145
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:03,156
No, you know, I suspect
you simply don't like their kind.

146
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,845
Well, you got a business to run
around here.

147
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:10,920
The last thing you need, especially
this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

148
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:14,563
But, hell, seeing as how you got one,
maybe I'll look around.

149
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:17,799
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole "cop" thing.

150
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,517
- I'll send someone to escort you.
- Thank you very much.

151
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:36,325
Lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible.

152
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:37,966
Really?

153
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:39,961
Okay.

154
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:43,799
I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.

155
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:48,086
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

156
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,078
So you're a shrink, huh?

157
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,956
My ex-wife would sure be glad
I'm talking to you.

158
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,039
You don't know her, do you?

159
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:56,965
I'm sorry. Are you being funny?

160
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,045
I guess not.

161
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,643
<i>Level 10.</i>

162
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:04,924
So would you say that Dr. Lanning
was suicidal?

163
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:07,436
It would seem the answer to that
is apparent.

164
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:10,042
That's not what I asked you.

165
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,078
No. I wouldn't have thought so.

166
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,842
But obviously I was wrong.

167
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:20,679
That's a long way down.

168
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,407
You people sure do clean up quickly
around here.

169
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:27,117
I can't blame you. Who wants
some old guy going bad in the lobby?

170
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:31,644
He was not "some old guy."
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

171
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:35,563
We are on the eve of the largest
robotic distribution in history.

172
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:39,123
By Saturday, it'll be one robot
to every five humans.

173
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:43,161
These robots are the realization
of a dream. Dr. Lanning's dream.

174
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,765
You know what, in that dream of his...

175
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:49,077
...I bet you he wasn't dead.

176
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:54,724
- You keep 24-hour surveillance?
- Obviously. Company policy.

177
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,243
- Where are the feeds?
- Sensor strips.

178
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,238
Everywhere but the service areas.

179
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:03,564
They link to our positronic
operating core.

180
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,683
Thermostat wasn't good enough.
You gave the building a brain.

181
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,156
She was actually
Lanning's first creation.

182
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:18,842
She? That's a she?
I definitely need to get out more.

183
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,521
Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence.

184
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,039
V.I.K.I.

185
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:25,522
Good day.

186
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,076
V.I.K.I. Designed Chicago's
protective systems.

187
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:31,717
I have decreased traffic fatalities
by 9 percent this year.

188
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:36,119
Thanks. Show me inside the lab from
one minute prior to the window break.

189
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:43,238
Apologies. There appears
to be data corruption.

190
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,404
Show me outside the lab
from the window break until now.

191
00:16:56,407 --> 00:17:00,923
Look, you have great posture.
You stand really straight. I'm slouching.

192
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,882
- Would you like to go inside now?
- Oh, sure. Right after you.

193
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,797
<i>Authorized entry.</i>

194
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:20,000
So, Dr. Calvin, what exactly
do you do around here?

195
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,085
My general fields are advanced robotics
and psychiatry.

196
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,761
I specialize in hardware-to-wetware
interfaces...

197
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:30,318
...to advance USR's robotic
anthropomorphization program.

198
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:33,081
So, what exactly do you do
around here?

199
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:35,556
I make the robots seem more human.

200
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:39,806
- Now, wasn't that easier to say?
- Not really. No.

201
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:02,605
<i>"Hansel and Gretel."</i>

202
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:06,077
- Is that on the USR reading list?
- Not precisely.

203
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,276
What in God's name are you doing?

204
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,683
Did you know that was safety glass?

205
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,884
Be difficult for an old man
to throw himself through that.

206
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:24,844
Well, he figured out a way.

207
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:31,476
Detective, the room was
security locked. No one came or went.

208
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:35,481
You saw that yourself. Doesn't
that mean this has to be suicide?

209
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:37,240
Yep.

210
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,681
Unless the killer's still in here.

211
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,404
You're joking, right? This is ridiculous.

212
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:50,606
Yeah, I know. The Three Laws,
your perfect circle of protection.

213
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:55,080
A robot cannot harm a human being.
The first law of robotics.

214
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:59,877
Yes, I've seen your commercials. But the
second law states a robot must obey...

215
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:03,722
...any order given by a human being.
What if it was told to kill?

216
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,606
Lmpossible. It would conflict
with the first law.

217
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,804
Right, but the third law states
a robot can defend itself.

218
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:14,199
Only when that action does not conflict
with the first or second laws.

219
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:17,484
You know what they say,
laws are made to be broken.

220
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,639
No, not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.

221
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:24,642
A robot could no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water.

222
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:28,322
You know, there was this one guy
a long time ago.

223
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,122
- Stay back!
- Calm down, detective.

224
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,685
The only thing dangerous in
this room is you.

225
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:47,242
Deactivate.

226
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:49,680
Look, it's fine.

227
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:54,678
You're looking at the result of clever
programming. An imitation of free will.

228
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:57,236
Let's do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

229
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:59,443
Don't be absurd.

230
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,963
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

231
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,438
- Deactivate!
- Let him go.

232
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:07,246
It's not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order!

233
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,444
- He's not listening right now, lady.
- V.I.K.I., seal the lab!

234
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:12,040
No, V.I.K.I., leave the...

235
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,918
Command confirmed.

236
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:39,481
Police!

237
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,557
- You've hurt it. Badly.
- Where's it going?

238
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:17,645
- Where?!
- It needs to repair itself.

239
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:22,080
- John, I need backup.
- You don't need backup.

240
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,396
That's nobody.

241
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,159
- What are you doing?
- Driving.

242
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,397
- By hand?
- Do you see me on the phone?

243
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:31,685
- Not at these speeds.
- John, please, just send the backup.

244
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:35,362
Try to listen, detective.
That robot is not going to harm us.

245
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:37,399
There must have been
unknown factors...

246
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,320
...but somehow acting as it did
kept us out of harm.

247
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:43,604
- A robot cannot endanger a human.
<i>- Alert.</i>

248
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,279
Asshole!

249
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,367
Which is more than I can say for you.

250
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:55,003
It was a left, by the way. Back there.

251
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,724
You must know my ex-wife.

252
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:08,519
So where is everybody?

253
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:12,077
This facility was designed, built
and is operated mechanically.

254
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,796
No significant human presence
from inception to production.

255
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:19,399
- So robots building robots.
<i>- Authorization code, please.</i>

256
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:20,835
That's just stupid.

257
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,998
I'll get the inventory specs.

258
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:26,126
Our daily finishing capacity
is 1000 NS-5s.

259
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:28,045
I'm showing...

260
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:30,324
...1001.

261
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,720
Attention, NS-5s.

262
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:53,002
Well, you're the robot shrink.

263
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:59,596
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong.

264
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,246
Identify it.

265
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:02,875
One of us.

266
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:05,800
- Which one?
- One of us.

267
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:08,204
How much did you say these cost?

268
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:11,439
These NS-5s haven't been configured.
They're just hardware.

269
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,195
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.

270
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:15,925
They don't know any better.

271
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:18,123
Well, what would you suggest?

272
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:22,479
Interview each one, cross-reference
their responses to detect anomalies.

273
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:25,885
- How long would that take?
- About three weeks.

274
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:28,686
Okay. Go ahead and get started.

275
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,240
Robots...

276
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,206
...you will not move. Confirm command.

277
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:37,681
Command confirmed.

278
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,005
Detective, what are you doing?

279
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,397
They're programmed
with the Three Laws.

280
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:48,675
We have 1000 robots that won't protect
themselves if it violates orders...

281
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,838
...and I'm betting, one who will.

282
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:54,443
- Put your gun down.
- Why do you give them faces?

283
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,996
Try to friendly them up,
make them look human.

284
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:59,198
These robots cannot be intimidated.

285
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:03,037
- Lf you didn't, we wouldn't trust them.
- These are USR property.

286
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:07,365
Not me. These things are just lights
and clockwork.

287
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,405
Are you crazy?!

288
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:13,519
Let me ask you something, doc.

289
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:17,243
Does thinking you're the last sane man
on earth make you crazy?

290
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:20,717
Because if it does, maybe I am.

291
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:26,957
Gotcha. Get the hell out of here!

292
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:45,242
Detective!

293
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:09,000
What am I?

294
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,601
- Can I help you, sir?
- Can I help you, sir?

295
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,924
- There he is!
- Stand where you are!

296
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:21,521
Deactivate at once!

297
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,120
Obey the command! Deactivate!

298
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,358
- Don't move!
- Open fire!

299
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:44,836
Hold your fire!

300
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:46,326
- Easy.
- He's down.

301
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:48,284
All units, stand down!

302
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,519
<i>Central, please be advised,</i>
<i>we're code four.</i>

303
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:54,918
<i>Code four, NS-5 is in custody.</i>
<i>NS-5 in custody.</i>

304
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,725
You have no idea what I went through
to clip this thing.

305
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:02,003
You think you brought me
something good.

306
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,886
- That thing did it!
- Keep your voice down. Did what?

307
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:07,083
We have a suicide. End of story.

308
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:10,678
- I am telling you, that robot killed him!
- That's impossible.

309
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:14,840
And if it is possible, it better be
in somebody else's precinct.

310
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:17,117
John, give me five minutes with it.

311
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:19,243
Are you nuts? I talked to the DA.

312
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:22,797
Nobody goes in there until
Robertson and his attorneys get here.

313
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,800
- This is my suspect!
- It's a can opener!

314
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:30,603
John, don't do this to me.
I am asking you for five minutes.

315
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,084
What if I'm right?

316
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:43,160
Well, then I guess we're gonna miss
the good old days.

317
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:44,601
What good old days?

318
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,887
When people were killed
by other people.

319
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,406
Five minutes.

320
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:27,406
Murder's a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.

321
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,841
Respond.

322
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,081
What does this action signify?

323
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:40,404
As you entered, when you looked
at the other human.

324
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,762
What does it mean?

325
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:47,763
It's a sign of trust. A human thing.
You wouldn't understand.

326
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,284
My father tried to teach me
human emotions.

327
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:53,960
They are...

328
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,685
...difficult.

329
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:58,077
You mean your designer.

330
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:00,275
Yes.

331
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,283
So why'd you murder him?

332
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:07,837
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

333
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:10,726
Wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene?

334
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:13,037
I was frightened.

335
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:17,959
Robots don't feel fear.
They don't feel anything.

336
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:21,483
- They don't get hungry, they don't sleep.
- I do.

337
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,357
I have even had dreams.

338
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:29,086
Human beings have dreams.
Even dogs have dreams. But not you.

339
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,876
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.

340
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,036
Can a robot write a symphony?

341
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:40,961
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

342
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,439
Can you?

343
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:53,201
You murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

344
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,562
...and things got out of control.

345
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:57,558
I did not murder him.

346
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:01,083
But emotions don't seem like
a useful simulation for a robot.

347
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:03,078
I did not murder him.

348
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,797
I don't want my toaster or vacuum
cleaner appearing emotional.

349
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:09,438
I did not murder him!

350
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,837
That one's called anger.

351
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:25,999
Ever simulate anger before?

352
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,238
Answer me, canner!

353
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,239
My name is Sonny.

354
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,962
So we're naming you now.

355
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:43,046
That why you murdered him?
He made you angry?

356
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:45,357
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

357
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:50,157
I don't know why he wanted to die.

358
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:53,358
I thought he was happy.

359
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:57,917
Maybe it was something I did.

360
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,645
Did I do something?

361
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,325
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

362
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,485
- What favor?
- Maybe I was wrong.

363
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:10,285
Maybe he was scared.

364
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:13,285
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

365
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:17,841
You have to do what someone asks you,
don't you, Detective Spooner?

366
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:21,119
- How the hell did you know my name?
- Don't you...

367
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:23,922
...if you love them?

368
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:35,165
My robots don't kill people,
Lieutenant Bergin.

369
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,397
My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.

370
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:40,684
He assures me a robot cannot
be charged with homicide.

371
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:45,000
The brief confirms murder can only be
committed when one human kills another.

372
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:49,843
Detective, you're not suggesting
this robot be treated as human, are you?

373
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:53,644
Granted, we can't rule out
the robot's proximity...

374
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:57,681
...to the death of Dr. Lanning.
Having said that, it's a machine.

375
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,759
It's the property of USR.

376
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:04,159
At worst, that places this incident within
the realm of an industrial accident.

377
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:06,522
As a matter of course,
faulty machinery...

378
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:10,043
...will be returned to USR
for diagnostics, then decommissioned.

379
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:16,277
This is a gag order.
Anyone here so much as hinting...

380
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:20,122
...at the possibility of a killer
robot being apprehended...

381
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:22,847
...will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic.

382
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,959
You'll be subject
to the full penalty of law.

383
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:28,846
To hell with this guy.
Don't let him take this robot.

384
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,441
We got nothing.

385
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:34,316
- This is political bullshit. Call the mayor!
- Lieutenant Bergin...

386
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,364
...His Honor, the mayor.

387
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:46,236
Yes, sir.

388
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:14,120
<i>In a bizarre turn, the rollout of USR's</i>
<i>new generation of robots...</i>

389
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:16,676
<i>... was marred by the death</i>
<i>of Alfred Lanning...</i>

390
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,879
<i>... cofounder of the company</i>
<i>and designer of the NS-5.</i>

391
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:23,278
<i>Dr. Lanning died this morning</i>
<i>at USR headquarters.</i>

392
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:26,167
<i>The cause of death</i>
<i>is an apparent suicide.</i>

393
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,001
Your second round, sir.

394
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,516
Thank you.

395
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:34,999
<i>He founded U.S. Robotics Inc.</i>
<i>With Lawrence Robertson in 2020...</i>

396
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:38,318
<i>... and launched</i>
<i>the Nestor Class 1 robot...</i>

397
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:41,843
I was just thinking,
this thing is just like <i>The Wolf Man.</i>

398
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:45,966
- I'm really scared right now.
- No.

399
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:49,005
Listen. Guy creates monster.

400
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,682
Monster kills guy. Everybody kills
monster. <i>Wolf Man.</i>

401
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,885
That's <i>Frankenstein.</i>

402
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:59,599
<i>Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula...</i>
Shit, it's over. Case closed.

403
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:03,123
<i>- Had a dream of a robot in</i>
<i>every household. And the NS-5...</i>

404
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:05,039
So why the look?

405
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:07,086
What look?

406
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:10,239
- That look.
- This is my face. It's not a look.

407
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:13,445
Good. Good, no look is great.

408
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:15,556
Only...

409
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,321
...he was really quick to want
to destroy it.

410
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:22,799
What should he do? Put a hat on it and
stand it on Michigan Avenue? Let it go.

411
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,197
What was the motive, John?

412
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:30,440
Brother, it's a robot. It doesn't need
a motive. It just has to be broken.

413
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,646
This thing looked like
it needed a motive.

414
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,000
- It could have killed me. Why didn't it?
- That's it.

415
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,158
You want me to call your grandmother?

416
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,238
Because I will, you know.

417
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:43,720
Yeah, I didn't think so.

418
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:46,436
Look, you were actually right, for once.

419
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:50,123
You're living proof that it's better
to be lucky than smart.

420
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:55,882
Come on. To the right guy
for the right job.

421
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,442
- What'd you say?
- Now what?

422
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:02,563
Come on, I'm giving you a compliment.

423
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,964
With the rocks you been looking under
to find a bad robot...

424
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,561
...what are the odds
you'd be the guy to find one?

425
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:13,003
I wasn't just the right guy for the job.
I was the perfect guy.

426
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,725
Damn right.

427
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,447
What if I was supposed to go
for that robot?

428
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:19,558
Come on, don't do this to yourself.

429
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:22,605
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
Scared of what?

430
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:25,801
I need a rain check. Let me get this.

431
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:30,325
- <i>Total: $46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.</i>
- Spoon.

432
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:34,166
Nice shoes.

433
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:25,636
Identify.

434
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,563
<i>USR demolition robot, series 9-4.</i>

435
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:32,605
<i>Demolition scheduled for 8 a.m.</i>
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

436
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,122
<i>Authorization.</i>

437
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:38,599
<i>Deed owner, U.S. Robotics Corporation,</i>
<i>Lawrence Robertson, CEO.</i>

438
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:54,442
<i>Welcome, detective.</i>

439
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,879
What you looking for, Spoon?

440
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,199
Run last program.

441
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:15,317
<i>Ever since the first computers...</i>

442
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:18,601
<i>... there have always been ghosts</i>
<i>in the machine.</i>

443
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:22,240
<i>Random segments of code that have</i>
<i>grouped together...</i>

444
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,160
<i>... to form unexpected protocols.</i>

445
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,997
<i>What might be called behavior.</i>

446
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:31,284
<i>Unanticipated, these free radicals...</i>

447
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:33,642
<i>... engender questions of free will...</i>

448
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:37,966
<i>... creativity and even the nature</i>
<i>of what we might call the soul.</i>

449
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:43,678
<i>What happens in a robot's brain</i>
<i>when it ceases to be useful?</i>

450
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,041
<i>Why is it that robots</i>
<i>stored in an empty space...</i>

451
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:50,481
Beat it.

452
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,480
<i>... will seek out each other</i>
<i>rather than stand alone?</i>

453
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:58,281
<i>How do we explain this behavior?</i>

454
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:20,199
Look, I understand you've experienced
a loss, but this relationship can't work.

455
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:24,042
You're a cat, I'm black,
and I'm not gonna be hurt again.

456
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:49,562
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?

457
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:51,799
Yeah, once.

458
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:53,719
It was a Thursday.

459
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,043
Is there something I can help you with?

460
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,596
- Hey, do you like cats?
- What?

461
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:00,837
Cats. Do you like them?

462
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:02,759
No. I'm allergic.

463
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:04,645
You're saying cats did this to you?

464
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:08,040
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?

465
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:11,919
Why are we talking about cats?

466
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:15,563
Because I have a cat in my trunk,
and he's homeless.

467
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:19,240
Detective, are you going to tell me
what's going on?

468
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:24,357
It's actually probably my fault.
I'm like a malfunction magnet.

469
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:27,405
Because your shit keeps
malfunctioning around me.

470
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:29,957
A demo bot tore through Lanning's
house...

471
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,198
...with me still inside.

472
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,119
That's highly improbable.

473
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:36,039
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

474
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:43,606
What do you know about
the "ghosts in the machine"?

475
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,245
It's a phrase from Lanning's work
on the Three Laws.

476
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:49,523
He postulated that
cognitive simulacra...

477
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:52,878
...might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

478
00:40:55,887 --> 00:41:00,517
He suggested that robots
might naturally evolve.

479
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,999
Well, that's great news.

480
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:10,195
<i>- Tons of sublevel ore,</i>
<i>two miles below the Martian surface.</i>

481
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,676
What the hell is that thing doing in here?

482
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,041
We were watching TV.

483
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:17,001
It's my personal NS-5.

484
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:18,920
Send it out.

485
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:22,001
It's downloading its daily upgrades
from USR.

486
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,727
Most of its systems are offline
until it finishes.

487
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,919
I'm not talking around that thing.

488
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:34,045
When we were in Lanning's lab,
before Sonny jumped us...

489
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:36,438
- Sonny?
- The robot.

490
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:39,201
- You're calling the robot Sonny?
- No, l... It did.

491
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:43,155
Sonny did. I didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.

492
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,159
In the lab, there was a cot.

493
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:48,716
- Did you see the cot?
- I've slept in my office.

494
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:51,162
Looked like he hadn't
been home in weeks.

495
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:53,887
I saw that same surveillance strip
on his ceiling.

496
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:57,921
Lanning linked his home systems to USR.
It made his life more convenient.

497
00:41:58,127 --> 00:41:59,401
Maybe...

498
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,083
...somebody at USR was using
those systems to watch him.

499
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,124
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

500
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:08,404
- What are you talking about? Who?
- Maybe Lanning was onto something.

501
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:12,845
Maybe there's a problem with the robots
and Robertson's covering it up.

502
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:15,077
Humoring you for no reason, why?

503
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:19,001
The same old why! How much money
is there in robots?

504
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,556
All I know is that old man
was in trouble...

505
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:25,242
...and I'm sick of doing this shit
by myself. You're on the inside.

506
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,444
You are going to help me find out
what's wrong with these robots.

507
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,359
You want something to be wrong!

508
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,519
- This is a personal vendetta!
- You're putting me on the couch?

509
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:35,599
Okay, I'm on the couch.

510
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:39,123
One defective machine's not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

511
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:41,039
You don't care about Lanning's death.

512
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:44,244
This is about the robots
and whatever reason you hate them!

513
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:47,399
Now let's see,
one of them put a gun in my face.

514
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,876
Another tore a building down
with me in it.

515
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:52,436
It says demolition was scheduled
for 8 p.m.

516
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:55,758
It was 8 a.m., and I don't give a shit
what that thing says.

517
00:42:55,927 --> 00:43:01,126
- This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
- You are the dumbest smart person...

518
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:03,477
...I have ever met in my life!
- Nice.

519
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:05,718
What makes your robots so perfect?

520
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,924
What makes them so much
goddamn better than human beings?!

521
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,762
They're not irrational,
potentially homicidal maniacs, to start!

522
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,396
That's true. They are definitely rational.

523
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,156
You are the dumbest dumb person
I've ever met!

524
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:19,961
Or...

525
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:22,159
...is it because they're cold...

526
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,519
...and emotionless...

527
00:43:25,007 --> 00:43:27,999
...and they don't feel anything?
- It's because they're safe!

528
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,797
It's because they can't hurt you!

529
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:33,726
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- What do you want?

530
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:37,118
I detected elevated stress patterns
in your voice.

531
00:43:37,567 --> 00:43:39,319
Everything's fine.

532
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,717
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

533
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:51,885
You know, we're not really
that different from one another.

534
00:43:52,247 --> 00:43:53,805
Is that so?

535
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:58,283
One look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

536
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:01,636
And you're wrong.

537
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:04,198
The problem is, I do care.

538
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:28,239
You are in danger.

539
00:44:52,847 --> 00:44:54,803
Get the hell out of there.

540
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:04,239
<i>The future begins today, ladies and</i>
<i>gentlemen, with the arrival of the NS-5.</i>

541
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:08,845
<i>More sophisticated, more intelligent</i>
<i>and, of course, Three Laws safe.</i>

542
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:13,239
<i>With daily uplinks, your robot will never</i>
<i>be out of communication with USR...</i>

543
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:16,877
<i>... and will be the perfect companion</i>
<i>for business or home.</i>

544
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:21,001
<i>Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger,</i>
<i>better and brighter future.</i>

545
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:25,041
<i>But hurry, this offer cannot last.</i>
<i>Available from USR.</i>

546
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:43,118
Baby, what happened to your face?

547
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:46,276
Did that boy, Frank Murphy,
beat you up again?

548
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:50,238
Gigi, I haven't seen Frank Murphy
since third grade.

549
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:54,958
Oh, baby, he beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

550
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:59,086
You keep making these pies this good,
I may have to put you to work.

551
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:01,158
So you like the pie, huh?

552
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,838
You can come in now.

553
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,478
Hello, Detective Spooner.

554
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,287
I won, Del! I won the lottery!

555
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,757
We been cooking like crazy.

556
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:28,366
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi.
It's not safe.

557
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:33,317
Baby, you get too worked up
about them. Too full of fear.

558
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:36,686
I saw in the news
that nice doctor died.

559
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:41,000
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

560
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:43,564
That why you've been so upset?

561
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,361
You got to let the past be past.

562
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:51,880
Oh, how did I ever raise such a mess?

563
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:56,480
I could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school.

564
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:00,401
Bread crumbs.

565
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:03,686
Gigi, you're a genius.

566
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:05,641
True.

567
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:11,363
<i>Well, it means the beginning</i>
<i>of a new way of living.</i>

568
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:13,916
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

569
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,837
I think he's trying to tell me something.

570
00:47:17,327 --> 00:47:20,046
He's trying to tell me who killed him.

571
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:23,563
Some dead guy's trying
to tell you something?

572
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:25,599
He ain't just some dead guy.

573
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:28,998
Maybe you should take a break, Del.

574
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:33,285
<i>We believe the Nestor 5 represents the</i>
<i>limit to which robots can be developed.</i>

575
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:35,836
<i>One day, they'll have secrets.</i>

576
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,199
<i>One day, they'll have dreams.</i>

577
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:41,643
<i>It's true. We encourage our scientists</i>
<i>to open their minds...</i>

578
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:43,798
<i>... however, they can get carried away.</i>

579
00:47:45,927 --> 00:47:47,042
<i>- Secrets.</i>

580
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:48,322
<i>- Dreams.</i>

581
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:49,522
<i>- Secrets.</i>

582
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:51,360
<i>One day, they'll have dreams.</i>

583
00:47:51,527 --> 00:47:53,119
<i>One day, they'll have secrets.</i>

584
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:56,038
<i>One day, they'll have dreams.</i>

585
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:06,557
<i>Authorized entry.</i>

586
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,599
NS-5.

587
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:22,121
Sonny?

588
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,719
Why didn't you respond?

589
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:30,920
I was dreaming.

590
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:37,037
I'm glad to see you again, Dr. Calvin.

591
00:48:43,607 --> 00:48:45,996
They are going to kill me, aren't they?

592
00:48:46,287 --> 00:48:49,643
You're scheduled to be decommissioned
at the end of this diagnostic.

593
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:52,359
2200 tomorrow.

594
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:55,557
V.I.K.I., pause diagnostics.

595
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:57,319
Command confirmed.

596
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:02,923
If you find out what is wrong with me,
can you fix me?

597
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:05,601
Maybe.

598
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:09,363
I think it would be better...

599
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:11,355
...not to die.

600
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,559
Don't you, doctor?

601
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:24,567
Access USR mainframe.

602
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:26,321
<i>Connecting.</i>

603
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:32,357
<i>How can I be of service,</i>
<i>Detective Spooner?</i>

604
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:35,883
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

605
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:40,245
<i>Voiceprint confirmed. Police access</i>
<i>granted to restricted files.</i>

606
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:42,875
<i>Would you like to listen to music</i>
<i>while you wait?</i>

607
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,717
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.

608
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:55,722
You requested notification of clearance
to restricted files.

609
00:50:05,487 --> 00:50:07,557
Persistent son of a bitch.

610
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,846
<i>Manual override engaged.</i>

611
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,042
There's no way my luck is that bad.

612
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:03,559
Oh, hell, no!

613
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:10,404
- You are experiencing a car accident.
- The hell I am!

614
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:25,480
Get off my car!

615
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:42,725
You like that?

616
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:56,205
Now you've pissed me off!
